# step 1 - download all transactions from 
# https://tableau.flowbirdhub.com/#/views/Mike_Test/Sheet1?:iid=1
#
# step 2 - read in and clean those data
# A - filter for ridership
# B - Transit Day
# C - process to find GPS errors
#
# step 3
# get our five sets of vals
# Full
# RB veh only
# MB veh only
# Platform only
# Vehicle only

# okay, so fb_rl_vals has validations that may be on the red line, and nulls
# need to match to vehicle location, then cut by lat long
# do not trust route labels from flowbird
# if the match is not good, count it towards invalid data
# 
# 
# fb_mb_vals has nulls, we know they were not on the red line
# but we still need to try to match to vmh, so we can determine route label
# if the match is not good, count it toward invalid data
# 
# 
# fb_vehicle_vals has the entire null set that we care about
# can skip matching nulls in fb_mb_vals and fb_rl_vals since all in here
#
# fb_platform_vals will all be red line validations, so we do not count those
# 
# essentially we know the following:
# fb_mb_vals with route labels are reportable
# fb_mb_vals with null rte labels are not reportable, but potentially fixable
# fb_rb_vals with route labels are not reportable, but potentially fixable
#   there are 90 labels in the extensions, and extensions in the 90
# fb_rb_vals with null rte labels are not reportable, but potentially fixable
# 
# we need to fix:
# 1. fb_mb_vals with null route labels
# 2. fb_rb_vals with null route labels
# 3. fb_rb_vals with route labels
# 1. and 2. are both contained in the fb_vehicle_vals with null rte labels
# 
# so, for brevity, fix:
# 1. fb_vehicle_vals with null rte labels
# 2. fb_rb_vals with route labels
# 
# then we need a % accuracy
# this will be:
# 1. unmatched validations
# 2. gapped validations, meaning the vmh time and transaction time differ by > 60s
# 3. bad GPS, where GPSStatus != 2 or is.na()
# 4. validation after VMH, where validation time is > last vmh for the transit_day
# 
# there are also some very strange validation gps pings, we should investigate
# perhaps some sort of like 
# 
# essentially you're going to need to combine this script with the vmh match one
# that you previously developed
